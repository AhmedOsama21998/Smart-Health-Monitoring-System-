# Smart-Health-Monitoring-System-

Continuous data monitoring with IoT will be a platform for the healthcare industry, which will enable doctors with quicker,smarter and effective methods of diagnosis. 
Statistical Analysis of Real time monitoring of patients and feeding the monitored data to the internet is going to be one of the big things in future.
IoT Healthcare can be used for critical patients needs to be under continuous observation; especially in the absence or unavailability of medical doctor.
Early detection of diseases is possible with IoT Healthcare applications and the doctor can be notified immediately.
IoT healthcare has a wide range of applications like Heart-rate monitoring, ECG monitoring, blood pressure monitoring,etc.
Here we will be discussing about ECG monitoring with IoT and the methodology of its implementation. 
This paper has proposed and implemented a Smart healthcare application using a IoT system based on AD8232 heart rate sensor 
interfaced with Arduino UNO and further connected to Cloud using an ESP8266 Wireless LAN Module.

Integration of healthcare with IoT has opened up a vast arena of development. 
It will not only facilitate healthcare but will also find out new measures to prevent diseases by processing data and by analyzing global trends.
Moreover, a vast future lies entirely on automation of hospitals and treatment mechanisms which can help the doctors understand diseases through artificial intelligence and IoT.
However, we should take a step at a time and not rush in into this field,
since it deals with human health and safety and security needs to be the top agenda. On a large scale,
this can also lead to cheaper treatments and cheaper nursing costs of patients.
If technology and health goes hand in hand, we can reach the goal of cheap, 
safe and efficient disease preventions and treatment.
